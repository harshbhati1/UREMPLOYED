            <p class="head1">Resume for the job - </p>
<p class="data">A resume is a compilation of the most important information which an employer needs to know when considering a new position. The job seeker`s relevant qualifications, training, and work history are given under easily understood resume headings such as "Summary of Qualifications," "Professional Experience," or "Education."
</p>


<p class="data6">How to start with job resume?</p>
<div class="containerab">
  <div class="rowxc">
    <div class="card-01a">
    
      <p class="yt"> Personal Detail and contact information</p>
      <p class="ytp"> At the top of your resume, include your name,  address, email, and phone number. And don't forget to make sure that every reply on your cell phone sounds professional. If they call you for an interview and get an unprofessional phone reply, they might hang up!</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card-02a">
      
      <p class="yt1">Personal Statement</p>
      <p class="ytp1"> The personal statement is the first thing a hiring manager will read. So it must get their attention. The ideal personal statement should be about 150-200 words long and contain powerful words and phrases that quickly explain who you are, your values, and what you can bring to the job.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card-01a">
    <p class="yt">Previous Work Experience</p>
    <p class="ytp"> This section details in chronological order all the work you have done in the past. Be sure to include the job title, the name of the organization, and the years you've worked there.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="rowxc">
    <div class="card-02a">
      <p class="yt1">Key Skills</p>
      <p class="ytp1"> The core skills are actually the strengths that can take on this role. It should be in a bulleted list. For example - <br> <br>
        - A fast learner with a proven track record of achievement;<br>
         - Proficient in the use of all Microsoft Office applications and a typing speed of 57 words per minute. </p>
  
    </div>
    <div class="card-01a">
      <p class="yt">Education and Qualifications </p>
      <p class="ytp">You must list your qualifications in the training section and include all relevant courses that you have attended and completed.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card-02a">
      <p class="yt1">Achievements</p>
      <p class="ytp1">  Again, this section should include a bulleted list of the proudest professional achievements. This is a great place to incorporate the numbers.
        For instance - <br> <br>
        -  Achieved a 25% increase in sales for my previous employer. This goal was reached through carefully targeted social media advertising
        campaigns.
      </p>
    </div>

  <div class="rowxc">
   
    <div class="card-02a">
      <p class="yt1">References</p>
      <p class="ytp1"> At the end of your resume, you need to include details of the two people who are willing to act as your positive reference. Your resume will be much more powerful and meaningful if it contains the names of the two references and the contact details.</p>

 <p class="data6">Tips for the resume - </p>
 <p class="data">
   1) Keep your resume relatively short (you only need 2 pages). Recruit managers need to search a lot of resumes and keep in mind that it's important to keep them short, meaningful, and sensible. <br>
   2) Make sure your resume is easy to read. The information you provide in your resume should be in a particular order and try to use a simple, professional-looking font like Arial. <br>
   3) When writing your resume, focus on your previous accomplishments that show you can ADD VALUE to their business in this role. And, that's great advice, include numbers in your resume if possible. <br>

   4) This is essential advice, but many applicants do not follow it. Please read your resume before sending it. If there are typos or if your resume contains many grammatical or punctuation errors, you will not be invited for an interview. Mistakes on your resume make it seem like you lack standards and attention to detail, so be sure to have someone proofread before you submit! <br>
   5) Again, this is a very handy trick you can use when writing your resume or  CV. Focus on using PROACTIVE LANGUAGE when building your CV. Active language consists of words that perform a specific ACTION. For example, words like executed, targeted, managed, built, developed, started, and recipe. <br>
