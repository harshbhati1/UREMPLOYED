           <p class="data">
            Employees must have role-specific knowledge and abilities in order to perform their job duties. Those who typically stand out as high performers, on the other hand, require some additional qualities, such as the ability to communicate clearly, work well with others, and manage their time effectively. </p>
            <img src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.w2W2MTfestPZ0z7QTtXDAQHaHa?w=199&h=199&c=7&r=0&o=5&pid=1.7" alt="" class="imgall ssimg1">
            <p class="data"> While it is difficult to define universal soft skills, you can think of them as skills that are not specific to one job; they are general characteristics that help employees thrive in the workplace, regardless of their seniority level, role, or industry. They are also known as transferable skills or interpersonal skills. </p>
            
            <p class="data"> Employees' personal qualities, behavior, and general characteristics are referred to as soft skills. Soft skills are useful in some jobs but less so in others. For example, if your company values collaboration, you should hire employees who are great team players and can communicate well with others. Networking and relationship-building skills, on the other hand, maybe necessary for sales and marketing roles but are irrelevant for engineering roles. Similarly, leadership skills are important for anyone who will manage a team, regardless of their department. Soft skills can be developed through lifelong professional and personal experiences. These abilities are not measurable, but they can be demonstrated. </p>
        <p class="data6">Why Soft Skills are important?</p>
        
        <p class="data">It is common in job advertisements to include requirements such as "communication skills" or "a problem-solving attitude." This is due to the fact that soft skills can help you:</p>
        <img src="collab.png" alt="" class="allimg ssimg2">
        <p class="data">
            • Identify employees who are not only capable of doing the job but are also capable of doing it well. <br>
            Example - An employee with good time management skills knows how to prioritize tasks to meet deadlines.
</p>

<p class="data">
    • Choose from a pool of qualified candidates who meet the job's basic standards. <br>
    Example - When two candidates have similar academic and professional backgrounds, the one who is more collaborative and flexible is more likely to be hired.
</p>
<p class="data">
    • Hire for potential rather than knowledge.  <br>
    Example - Rather than hiring an expert, it makes sense to look for candidates with a "desire to learn" and a "flexible character" for a junior role.

</p>
<p class="data">
    • Make well-informed recruiting selections. <br>
    Example - When looking for a salesperson, employers seek for someone who is familiar with the business and has sales expertise, but who is also resilient, knows how to bargain, and has strong verbal communication skills.

</p>
<p class="data6">How Soft skills differ from Hard skills?</p>
<p class="data">The term "hard skills" refers to the job-related knowledge and skills that individuals require in order to properly perform their job tasks. Soft skills, on the other hand, are personal characteristics that enable people to succeed in the workplace. Hard skills assist you in identifying individuals who are good on paper, while soft skills reveal which of these applicants are also good in person. This means that every employee must have a strong blend of hard and soft talents in order to be successful in their profession.</p>
<img src="undraw_Developer_activity_re_39tg.png" alt="" class="allimg ssimg3">
<p class="data">For instance, assume that you're looking for a developer. Knowledge of certain programming languages (e.g., Java), frameworks, and tools are some examples of hard skills required for this profession. Collaboration, problem-solving mentality, and time management talents, on the other hand, are examples of useful soft skills.
</p>
<p class="data">Employees gain hard skills through schooling and on-the-job training, while soft skills are gained through a variety of life-long professional and personal experiences. Hard talents can be measured and defined numerically or using yes/no criteria. Soft talents, on the other hand, are frequently intangible or difficult to quantify, and are typically defined with qualitative scales.</p>
<p class="data">Hard skills can be evaluated using resumes, portfolios, job-related assignments, and job interview questions. Soft skills, on the other hand, are better measured by asking situational and behavioural interview questions, conducting soft skills questions and tests, and considering a candidate's overall personality qualities as displayed during the hiring process.</p>
