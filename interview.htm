            <p class="head1">Job Interviews - </p>
            <p class="data">
              There are important steps you can take to be successful in an interview or recruitment. First, remember that job interviews are two-way communication. It is a tool which employers use to evaluate you, it also gives you the ability to evaluate jobs, organizations, and determine if there is a "suitable" position for you in the organization. <br> 
      Preparation and practice in advance are two keys to a successful interview. The following suggestions will help you prepare for the interview.
      <p class="data6">Self-evaluation - 
      </p>
      <p class="data">
        It's important to think about yourself and your past experience, to be clear about what you can offer to your employer. You can take reference from the below-given topics - <br>
        <img src="https://bemycareercoach.com/wp-content/uploads/self-assessment1.jpg" alt="" class="inte1">
        <li class="data">How do your current and new experience relate to the position?
        </li>
        <li class="data"> Your current and future career goals.
        </li>
        <li class="data">What skills and expertise do you have to offer?
        </li>
        <li class="data">The skills that you would like to develop or improve.
        </li>
        <li class="data">Location, salary, and lifestyle priorities.</li>
        <li class="data">Kinds of people and environments you prefer.
        </li>

        </li>
        <p class="data6">Tips before the interview - 
        </p>
        <p class="data">
          <img src="reearch.png" alt="" class="allimg inte2">
          1)<b> Research about Company </b>- The website of a corporation is a great source tostart. It usually tells you whether the company is multinational or domestic, how much money it makes, how many locations it has, and what its main goods are. The majority of businesses are highly proud of their websites. The interviewer might ask you whether you have checked their website or not? <br>
          2) <b>Practice interviews</b> - Make a set of available interview questions, then have a buddy serve as an interviewer and direct the questions to you in a rehearsal interview. Don't stop until you're confident in your ability to answer each question. You will feel much more comfortable and relaxed during the interview if you have practiced it previously. <br>
          3) <b>Arrival</b>  - Arrive a little early at the interview site. This provides you time to figure out where you need to go and a few minutes to gather your thoughts. Please don't be late. Arriving late and having no explanation will doom your chances of impressing an employer. If you find out at the last minute that you will be late for the interview, phone and inform the interviewer. Interviewers are aware that unexpected events can occur. If you phone and let them know that you're running late, you're never considered tardy. <br>
          <img src="dress.png" alt="" class="all img inte3">
          4)<b> Dress Professionally</b> - Wearing a suit isn't necessarily required in today's world. Find out what the dress code is for the company where you are going to interview by contacting the HR Manager or your recruiter. Then dress a notch higher. Men can wear dress slacks, a dress shirt, and a sport coat to a business casual event and  Women can wear a pantsuit, a dress, or anything else they want. The importance of first impressions cannot be overstated. As a result, if in doubt, always wear appropriate.
      
      
        </p>
        <p class="data6">During the interview - 
        </p>
        <p class="data">
          1) <b>First impressions</b> - It only takes thirty seconds to make a first impression. Interpersonal contact requires making direct and sustained eye contact, a solid handshake, a pleasant smile, decent posture, and confidently presenting yourself. It's crucial to have a well-groomed, professional appearance. Whether the interviewer is a woman or a guy, greet them with a firm handshake. (There's nothing worse than a shaky handshake.) When shaking hands, make sure to keep eye contact. <br>
          <img src="smile.png" alt="" class="allimg inte4">
          2)<b> Smile </b> - A candidate's confidence is shown in his or her smile. Make an effort to smile frequently. Also, when answering questions, don't be scared to utilize some hand animation. This indicates a candidate's excitement. <br>
          3) <b>Body Language</b> - Maintain solid posture and direct your eyes directly towards the interviewer. Straighten your back. <br>
          4)<b> Speak Clearly</b> - Don't talk in hushed tones. It conveys a lack of self-assurance. Speak confidently. This demonstrates self-assurance. <br>
          5) <b>Listen Before Answering</b> - Allow the employer to start the interview, but have some starting remarks or questions ready, such as "I understand that this position entails..." or "What are you looking for in a job candidate?" Make sure that you understand the question. If not, request clarification from the interviewer. Don't be scared to pause and consider your response. Someone who thinks about an answer before speaking impresses interviewers. <br>
          6) <b>Previous Employers</b> - Never, ever speak negatively about your previous employment. No matter how much you hated someone, find a method to turn your negative experiences into positive ones. <br>
         
          7) <b>Be Truthful</b> - When you're asked about something you haven't done, don't lie. Because the next inquiry will be "Tell us about it". <br>
          8)<b> Keep things at a professional level</b> -  Near the end of an interview, the two sides may begin to feel at ease with one another. Don't allow your relaxed mood to get the best of you.  Because You can tell them something that they shouldn't know about yourself, which can create a trouble for you.  Therefore, maintain a professional attitude at all times. <br>
           <p class="data6">After the interview - 
          </p>
          <p class="data">
            1)<b> Get Everyone's Business Card</b> - Before you depart, make a habit of collecting the business cards of everyone you met. If you're unable to do so, inquire for their names and e-mail addresses from a secretary. <br>
            <img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcT2h3Xp3eUjtKwJQ7ZsegqfIxMGGFXjlkLhqg&usqp=CAU" alt="" class="imgall inte6">
            2)<b> Thank the Interviewer</b> - Before departing, thank the interviewer verbally for taking the time to interview you. Send thank-you letters to every interviewer with whom you speak within a day. This does not have to be a written letter; an e-mailed thank-you would serve. <br>
       
        
        </p>
      <p class="data6">Additional Tips - 
      </p>
      <p class="data">
        1) If you're asked to discuss a problem, focus on the lessons you've learned rather than the faults. <br>
        2) Concentrate on presenting a cheerful, confident tone. <br>
        3) Look for particular, rather than broad, instances from your experience that highlight important aspects of yourself. <br>
        4) Focus on experiences that show flexibility, adaptability, responsibility, progress, achievement, innovation, initiative, and leadership while responding to questions. <br>
        5) After the interview, express your gratitude for the opportunity to interview and learn more about the company, confirm your interest, and underline how your history and abilities can be beneficial to the company. <br>
