# 🌟 UREMPLOYED: Empowering Youth for Employment

## 📖 Overview

**UREMPLOYED** is a website I developed to assist unemployed youth in India by providing them with the necessary tools and knowledge to secure employment. The platform addresses the root causes of unemployment, identifies common problems faced by job seekers, and offers practical solutions. Additionally, the website highlights what actions to take and what to avoid during the job search process.

## 🚨 Problem Statement

Unemployment among youth in India is a pressing issue, driven by various factors such as:

- 🎓 Lack of access to quality education

These challenges create barriers that prevent young people from securing stable and fulfilling employment.

## 🔍 Research and Insights

I conducted extensive research on the importance of soft skills in the workplace, engaging with startups and industry leaders in Jodhpur and Delhi to identify the most essential soft skills for employment. This research has been integrated into the training provided on UREMPLOYED.
