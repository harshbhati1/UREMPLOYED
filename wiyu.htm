            <p class="head">What is Youth Unemployment?
            </p>

            <p class="data p1"  >Youth unemployment is a prominent problem around the world. Most countries in the world face a severe lack of jobs for young people. Unemployment is the proportion of the labor force that is unable to find paid employment but is available for work. According to the International Labor Organization , young people are three times more likely to lose their job than adults, and nearly 73 million young people worldwide are looking for work. The term Youth generally refers to people between the age group of 16 and 24. As per United Nations, youth unemployment is the situation in which a youth is unable to get a job due to lack of skills, being less educated, and much more.</p>

            <p class="head he1">Youth Unemployment in India - </p>
            
            <p class="data p10"> “Poverty and unemployment among the educated class collectively give birth to an act of sabotage. It not only renders an individual poor but also wicked.” <br>   ―Dr. Radha Krishnan.</p>
            <img src="https://media.gettyimages.com/photos/educated-unemployed-youth-selling-tea-as-during-bharat-bachao-rally-picture-id1188709484?k=20&m=1188709484&s=612x612&w=0&h=zkmUTej336F_GdokV2dlqdFhIhDZvxXuJIg7OwFRBWQ=" alt="" class="imgp2"> 
             <p class="data pa2">Young people are a major human resource for development, key agents for social change, and driving force for economic development and technological innovation. But in India, the unemployment rate is higher for educated people than for uneducated people. This is because opportunities for work in urban areas are not growing as fast as the number of educated people. Educational unemployment is more dangerous to the country's economy. Youth unemployment and underemployment would remain a serious policy issue for many more years in India. India has paid a lot of attention to young people since independence and varied youth welfare activities, including the promotion of sports, have been designed and developed.

            <p class="head">Youth Unemployment in India in contrast to other Asian and European countries - 
            </p>
            <p class="data pa4">
              <img src="https://images.livemint.com/r/LiveMint/Period2/2017/03/06/Photos/Processed/g_m2m_oecd_web.jpg" alt="" class="imgpa4">
              According to the usual statistic, youth unemployment seems to be quite moderate in many Asian countries, especially in Korea and also in India. Germany, with a  current unemployment rate of young people at 7.7 percent, is one of the very few European countries that surpass India. The Netherlands, Austria, and Switzerland are the other European countries with moderate youth unemployment rates. Young women in India face a higher risk of unemployment than men, in particular in urban areas, whereas in most European countries young women have – in contrast to former times – lower unemployment rates than men, particularly in Germany.
              </p>
              
              <p class="data pa5">When we talk about South Asia, India is the only country in South Asia with the lowest unemployment rate, while Afghanistan has the highest unemployment rate. As we know, South Asia is one of the most densely populated regions in the world, and some prominent scholars consider it to be a reasonable factor in increasing unemployment</p>
              <p class="data pa6">However, if young people are utilized properly and provided with better opportunities,  then countries will develop automatically and can be free from all socio-economic problems. Because youth can change the fate of a nation.</p>
