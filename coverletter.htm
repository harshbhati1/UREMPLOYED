    <p class="data clp1">A cover letter is a one-page document that you submit as part of your job application (along with your resume). Its goal is to introduce you and briefly summarize your professional background. A well-written cover letter can increase your chances of landing an interview and ultimately landing the job. Sometimes your cover letter is the first thing a recruiter sees and you want to make sure that it makes a good impression. Your cover letter should be approximately 2-3 paragraphs.Try to keep it to half or two-thirds of a page long.</p>

    The second paragraph should discuss your qualifications and achievements showing why you are a good fit for the job. Use compelling language and don't repeat information on your resume. Try to bring your experience to life and it will encourage readers to look at your resume in more detail.

Dear Mr. Watson,
</pre>
<p class="data" style="font-style: italic;">I am writing to express my interest in the accountant position you have opened on your company website with job number 11220. I am a Certified Public Accountant (CPA) and I believe that the experience and skills would be a great fit for this position.
</p>
<p class="data" style="font-style: italic;">I have a solid knowledge of accounting principles supported by the experience I have gained over the past 12 years. In my previous position, I managed the accounting of a financial consulting firm with over $30 million in revenue. Not only did I live up to expectations, but I exceeded them by increasing cash flow by $4 million. I helped achieve this goal by changing the accounts receivable policy and negotiating better contracts. There are more details about my experience and skills in my CV that I would appreciate for your consideration.</p>
<p class="data" style="font-style: italic;">I am certain that my experience and skills will make me an excellent candidate for this position as well as a great asset to your business.
